# How to Convert BTD Files to PDF Online for Free
 
BTD files are business-in-a-box documents that contain templates, forms, contracts, and other documents for various purposes. They are created by the Business-in-a-Box software, which is a popular tool for entrepreneurs and small businesses. However, BTD files are not widely supported by other programs and devices, and they may not be easy to share or edit. That's why you may want to convert them to PDF files, which are more universal and secure.
