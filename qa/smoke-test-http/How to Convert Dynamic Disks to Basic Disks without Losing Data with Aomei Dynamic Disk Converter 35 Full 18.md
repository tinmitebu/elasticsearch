Dynamic disks are a type of disk that can offer more flexibility and functionality than basic disks, such as creating volumes that span multiple disks, mirroring volumes for fault tolerance, or striping volumes for improved performance. However, dynamic disks also have some limitations and drawbacks, such as being incompatible with some operating systems or applications, requiring more disk space for metadata, or being harder to recover data from in case of disk failure.
